# Generate Image Skill

Generate high-quality images using Google's Gemini API directly, with Replicate as fallback.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Model Requirement

**This skill uses Google Gemini API (`gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`) as the PRIMARY method, with `google/nano-banana-pro` via Replicate as the FALLBACK.**

- **PRIMARY**: Always try Google Gemini API directly first
- **FALLBACK**: If Gemini fails (rate limit, timeout, unavailable), use Replicate API
- **DO NOT** use any other image generation models (FLUX, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, etc.)
- The acceptable API endpoints are:
  1. PRIMARY: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview:generateContent`
  2. FALLBACK: `https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/google/nano-banana-pro/predictions`

If both methods fail, report the error to the user and ask how they'd like to proceed (retry, modify prompt, or abandon).

## Usage

Invoke this skill with:
```
/generate-image
```

In Codex, use this skill whenever the user asks to generate images or when building websites that need visual content.

## Codex Runtime Notes

When using this skill inside Codex, prefer the bundled helper script instead of hand-writing `curl` calls:

```bash
python3 /Users/georgelane/.codex/skills/generate-image/scripts/generate_image.py \
  --prompt "YOUR_PROMPT_HERE" \
  --aspect-ratio 4:5 \
  --resolution 2K \
  --out output.png
```

The helper:
- Calls Gemini `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` first.
- Uses `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` if present.
- Falls back to the local token embedded in this skill file when environment variables are not exported in the Codex shell.
- Supports optional `--reference /path/to/image`.
- Supports `--fallback` for Replicate if Gemini fails and a Replicate token is available.

Use `/Users/georgelane/.codex/skills/generate-image/references/...` for prompt-library searches in Codex.

## Automatic Triggers

This skill will automatically activate when:
- Building websites, landing pages, or web applications
- Creating placeholder images for web projects
- Generating hero images, banners, or headers
- Creating illustrations for blog posts or content
- Making icons, logos, or graphics for web projects
- Any explicit request to generate or create images

## What This Skill Does

1. Takes your image description (prompt) and optional parameters
2. Calls the Google Gemini API to generate the image (falls back to Replicate if needed)
3. Downloads the generated image to your current directory (or specified web project directory)
4. Verifies image quality — checks for AI artifacts, fine detail accuracy, and physical realism
5. Auto-regenerates with improved prompts if quality check fails (up to 3 attempts)
6. Shows you the result
7. When building websites, automatically saves images in appropriate project directories (e.g., `public/images/`, `assets/`, etc.)

## 🆕 Prompt Library (6,000+ Curated Templates)

This skill includes a library of 6,000+ proven prompts sourced from viral AI artists, organized by category. Use these when you want quick results or inspiration.

### When to Use Library vs Custom

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| "I need a social media post image" | **Library** - search social-media-post category |
| "Generate a YouTube thumbnail" | **Library** - search youtube-thumbnail category |
| "I want something like [reference]" | **Library** - find similar templates |
| "Illustrate this article..." | **Library** - content illustration mode |
| Specific creative vision with details | **Custom** - JSON prompt engineering |
| Professional website photography | **Custom** - use photorealistic guidelines |
| Need precise control over every element | **Custom** - JSON prompt engineering |

### Available Categories

| Category | File | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| Profile/Avatar | `profile-avatar.json` | Profile pictures, headshots, avatars, 3D characters |
| Social Media | `social-media-post.json` | Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok content (3,800+ prompts) |
| Product Marketing | `product-marketing.json` | Product shots, marketing visuals (1,900+ prompts) |
| YouTube Thumbnails | `youtube-thumbnail.json` | Click-worthy video thumbnails |
| E-commerce | `ecommerce-main-image.json` | Product listings, main images |
| Infographics | `infographic-edu-visual.json` | Data visualization, educational content |
| Posters/Flyers | `poster-flyer.json` | Event posters, promotional flyers |
| Comics | `comic-storyboard.json` | Comic panels, storyboards, sequential art |
| Game Assets | `game-asset.json` | Game graphics, sprites, characters |
| App/Web Design | `app-web-design.json` | UI mockups, web graphics, app screens |
| Others | `others.json` | Miscellaneous styles |

### Library Workflow

**Step 1: Detect Mode**
- If user mentions a category or wants inspiration → Library mode
- If user provides content to illustrate → Content illustration mode
- If user has specific creative vision → Custom JSON mode (skip to existing workflow)

**Step 2: Search the Library**
Use grep to search relevant category files. NEVER load entire files into context.

```bash
# Example: Search for "cyberpunk" in social media posts
grep -i "cyberpunk" /Users/georgelane/.codex/skills/generate-image/references/social-media-post.json | head -20
```

**Step 3: Present Recommendations**
- Show maximum 3 matching prompts
- Include: title, description, and sample image URL (sourceMedia)
- Use EXACT prompt text from library - do not modify
- Note if prompt requires reference images (needReferenceImages: true)

**Step 4: User Selection**
- User picks a prompt → Use it directly for generation
- User wants customization → Remix the selected prompt with their requirements
- User wants something different → Search again or switch to custom mode

### Content Illustration Mode

When user provides article/content to illustrate:

1. **Analyze the content** - Identify key themes, mood, subject matter
2. **Map to categories** - Which categories best match the content?
3. **Search for matching styles** - Find prompts that complement the content
4. **Present options** - Show 3 style templates with previews
5. **Remix if needed** - Customize selected template to match specific content elements

### Prompt Entry Structure

Each library prompt has these fields:
```json
{
  "content": "The actual prompt text (use this for generation)",
  "title": "Short descriptive title",
  "description": "What this prompt generates",
  "sourceMedia": ["URL to example image"],
  "needReferenceImages": false  // true if user must provide reference image
}
```

### Category Keywords for Routing

Map user requests to categories:

| User Says | Route To |
|-----------|----------|
| "avatar", "profile pic", "headshot", "pfp" | profile-avatar |
| "instagram", "twitter", "social", "post" | social-media-post |
| "product", "marketing", "ad", "advertisement" | product-marketing |
| "thumbnail", "youtube", "video cover" | youtube-thumbnail |
| "listing", "ecommerce", "shop", "store" | ecommerce-main-image |
| "infographic", "chart", "data", "educational" | infographic-edu-visual |
| "poster", "flyer", "event", "announcement" | poster-flyer |
| "comic", "manga", "storyboard", "panel" | comic-storyboard |
| "game", "sprite", "character", "asset" | game-asset |
| "app", "ui", "interface", "mockup", "web design" | app-web-design |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Avoiding AI-Looking Images

**When the user wants realistic/photographic images**, ALWAYS enhance their prompt with:

**Must Include:**
- "professional photography" or "shot on [camera]" (e.g., Canon EOS R5, Nikon Z9)
- "anatomically correct" + "natural proportions" (especially for people!)
- "natural lighting" + specific light direction (e.g., "window light from left")
- "authentic" + "realistic details" + "not AI generated"
- Camera specs: "50mm f/2.8", "natural grain", "shallow depth of field"
- **"no text", "no words", "no typography"** (text in AI images looks fake!)

**For People/Portraits (Critical!):**
- ALWAYS add: "anatomically correct, two hands visible, natural proportions"
- ALWAYS add: "natural skin texture with subtle pores and imperfections"
- NEVER use: "perfect", "flawless", "stunning" → Use "authentic", "natural" instead

**Never Include Text:**
- ALWAYS add: "no text, no words, no letters, no typography"
- AI-generated text looks unrealistic and screams "AI-made"
- If the user needs text, add it separately using design tools after generation
- Remove any mention of signs, labels, text, or written content from prompts

**Lighting Specifics (Makes it Real):**
- NOT: "good lighting" → USE: "soft window light from right creating gentle shadows"
- NOT: "studio lighting" → USE: "natural diffused daylight, overcast conditions"
- Add natural imperfections: "slight shadow under nose", "subtle rim light"

**Quick Formula for Realistic Images:**
```
[Subject] + professional photography + anatomically correct + natural proportions +
natural skin texture + authentic expression + shot on Canon EOS R5 with [lens] +
[specific lighting direction] + no text + no words + photojournalistic style +
realistic details + not AI generated
```

**Example:**
Instead of: "person in office"
Use: "professional photography of business person in modern office, anatomically correct proportions, two hands visible, natural skin texture with subtle pores, authentic expression, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 50mm f/2.8 lens, soft window lighting from right side, slight shadows, no text, no words, photojournalistic style, realistic details, not AI generated"

### For Scenes With Equipment, Tools, or Technical Objects

**IMPORTANT**: AI models frequently fail on fine physical details — pipes that don't connect, tools with wrong shapes, equipment with impossible geometry. Use these rules to prevent issues from the start:

- **ALWAYS** describe each object's material, condition, and how it connects to other objects
- **ALWAYS** specify realistic wear and imperfections: "slight scratches", "dust", "minor discoloration at joints"
- **ALWAYS** include real-world specifics: brand names, standard sizes, industry-standard configurations
- **NEVER** rely on the model to "know" what a boiler installation looks like — describe every pipe, valve, and fitting
- Add to constraints: `"every mechanical/technical detail must be physically accurate and functional"`

**Quick Formula for Detail-Heavy Scenes:**
```
[Subject] + [specific material/texture for each object] + [explicit connections between objects] +
[realistic wear/imperfections] + [correct scale references] + [industry-specific terminology] +
professional photography + natural lighting + no text
```

**Example:**
Instead of: "boiler installation in a kitchen"
Use: "professional photograph of a Worcester Bosch Greenstar 8000 combi boiler wall-mounted in a modern kitchen, 22mm copper pipes with compression fittings connecting to the boiler, pipes running neatly along the wall with chrome pipe clips at 300mm intervals, pressure gauge reading 1.5 bar, condensate pipe in 21.5mm white plastic waste pipe running to external wall, slight green patina on copper joints, realistic pipe bends with no impossible angles, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 35mm f/2.8, natural kitchen lighting from window, no text, no words, every detail physically accurate"

## Model Capabilities

**Google Nano Banana Pro** is built on Gemini 3 Pro and offers:
- High-quality image generation with detailed visuals
- Support for reference images (up to 14 images for transformation)
- Multiple resolution options (1K, 2K, 4K)
- Various aspect ratios
- Photorealistic outputs when prompted correctly

## How to Use

When invoked, you'll be asked for:

1. **Prompt** (required): Describe the image you want to generate
   - Be specific and detailed
   - Include style, mood, lighting, composition details
   - **Never include text/words in the image** - add text separately using design tools

2. **Resolution** (optional): Choose image quality
   - `1K` - Faster, lower cost ($0.15)
   - `2K` - Balanced quality/cost (default, $0.15)
   - `4K` - Highest quality ($0.30)

3. **Aspect Ratio** (optional): Image dimensions
   - Common ratios: `1:1`, `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `3:4`
   - Other options: `2:3`, `3:2`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `21:9`
   - Default: `match_input_image` (1:1 if no input image)

4. **Output Format** (optional): File type
   - `jpg` (default) - Smaller file size
   - `png` - Higher quality, transparency support

5. **Safety Filter Level** (optional): Content filtering
   - `block_only_high` (default) - Most permissive
   - `block_medium_and_above` - Moderate filtering
   - `block_low_and_above` - Strictest filtering

6. **Save Location** (when building websites): Specify where to save the image
   - Auto-detect project structure and suggest appropriate directory
   - Default to common patterns like `public/images/`, `assets/`, `static/`, etc.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Determine Mode and Gather Parameters

**First, detect which mode to use:**

1. **Library Mode** - User wants templates/inspiration OR mentions a category
   - Search the appropriate reference file(s) using grep
   - Present up to 3 matching prompts with titles, descriptions, and sample images
   - Wait for user selection
   - If user picks a prompt, use it directly (or remix with their customizations)
   - Proceed to Step 2 with the selected/remixed prompt

2. **Content Illustration Mode** - User provides article/content to illustrate
   - Analyze the content for themes, mood, subject matter
   - Search relevant categories for matching styles
   - Present 3 style options with sample images
   - Remix selected template to match the specific content
   - Proceed to Step 2

3. **Custom Mode** - User has specific creative vision
   - Ask for prompt and optional parameters (resolution, aspect ratio, format)
   - Convert their description into a full JSON prompt (see "JSON Prompting" section below)
   - Proceed to Step 2

**For Library/Content modes:**
```bash
# Search example - find cyberpunk avatars
grep -i "cyberpunk" /Users/georgelane/.codex/skills/generate-image/references/profile-avatar.json

# Search multiple categories
grep -i "neon" /Users/georgelane/.codex/skills/generate-image/references/social-media-post.json /Users/georgelane/.codex/skills/generate-image/references/profile-avatar.json
```

**For Custom mode**, use sensible defaults if not specified:
- Resolution: 2K
- Format: jpg
- Aspect ratio: based on use case (16:9 for heroes, 1:1 for avatars, etc.)

For website projects, also determine the appropriate save location based on the project structure.

### 2. Call Google Gemini API (Primary)

Use the Google Gemini API to generate the image. This is a synchronous call that returns the image directly.

**Gemini API Token:**
```
${GEMINI_API_KEY}
```

**API Call (text-only prompt):**
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview:generateContent" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: ${GEMINI_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "contents": [{
      "parts": [
        {"text": "YOUR_PROMPT_HERE"}
      ]
    }],
    "generationConfig": {
      "responseModalities": ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]
    }
  }'
```

**API Call (with reference image):**

When the user provides a reference image (local file path or URL), include it as `inlineData` in the parts array alongside the text prompt. The image must be base64-encoded.

```bash
# First, base64-encode the reference image (strip newlines for JSON compatibility)
REF_IMAGE_B64=$(base64 -i /path/to/reference-image.jpg | tr -d '\n')

# Then include it in the API call
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview:generateContent" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: ${GEMINI_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "contents": [{
      "parts": [
        {"text": "YOUR_PROMPT_HERE. Use the provided reference image as a guide for style/composition/subject."},
        {
          "inlineData": {
            "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
            "data": "'"${REF_IMAGE_B64}"'"
          }
        }
      ]
    }],
    "generationConfig": {
      "responseModalities": ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]
    }
  }'
```

**Reference image notes:**
- Set `mimeType` to match the file: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, or `image/gif`
- You can include up to 14 reference images by adding more `inlineData` parts
- For URLs: download the image first with `curl -s -o /tmp/ref.jpg "URL"`, then base64-encode it
- Tell the model HOW to use the reference in your text prompt (e.g., "match the style of", "transform this image to", "use as composition reference")
- Only include reference images when the user explicitly provides them or when a library prompt has `needReferenceImages: true`

**Important**: Since Gemini doesn't have separate resolution/aspect ratio parameters, include these in the prompt itself:
```
Original prompt: "A sunset over mountains"
With params: resolution=4K, aspect_ratio=16:9

Enhanced prompt: "A sunset over mountains. Ultra high resolution 4K quality. Wide cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio composition."
```

### 3. Extract and Save the Image

The Gemini response returns base64-encoded image data. Extract and save it:

```bash
# The response JSON contains: candidates[0].content.parts[].inlineData.data
# Extract and decode the base64 image data:

curl -s -X POST \
  "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview:generateContent" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: ${GEMINI_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "contents": [{"parts": [{"text": "YOUR_PROMPT_HERE"}]}],
    "generationConfig": {"responseModalities": ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]}
  }' | jq -r '.candidates[0].content.parts[] | select(.inlineData) | .inlineData.data' | base64 -d > output.png
```

**Note**: Gemini returns PNG by default. If you need JPG, convert after saving or use the Replicate fallback which supports format selection.

### 4. Download and Save

Once succeeded, download the image from the URL in the `output` field.

**Method 1: Meaningful filename (recommended for web projects)**
```bash
# Use descriptive names based on the content
curl -s -o hero-banner.jpg "OUTPUT_URL"
curl -s -o team-photo.jpg "OUTPUT_URL"
curl -s -o logo-icon.png "OUTPUT_URL"
```

**Method 2: Timestamped filename (recommended for testing/general use)**
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Assign timestamp to variable first, then use it
# This is more reliable than inline command substitution
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
curl -s -o "generated-image-${TIMESTAMP}.jpg" "OUTPUT_URL"
```

**Method 3: Simple incremental naming**
```bash
# For quick testing
curl -s -o generated-image-1.jpg "OUTPUT_URL"
curl -s -o generated-image-2.jpg "OUTPUT_URL"
```

For website projects, use Method 1 with meaningful filenames based on the content (e.g., `hero-banner.jpg`, `team-photo.jpg`, `logo-icon.png`).

### 5. Quality Verification Loop

After saving the image, verify its quality before presenting to the user. This step is **automatic and mandatory** — do not ask the user whether to verify.

**Bypass:** If the user says "skip verification", "fast mode", "no QC", or similar, skip this step entirely.

#### How It Works

1. **Inspect the saved image** using Codex `view_image` when a visual quality check is needed
2. **Evaluate** against the quality rubric below, with special focus on fine physical details
3. **Decide**: ACCEPT / ACCEPT WITH CAVEAT / REJECT
4. If REJECT and attempts remain → modify the prompt, delete the failed image, regenerate
5. If REJECT and no attempts remain → present options to the user

**Retry limits:** MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3 (1 initial + 2 retries). Worst case cost: 3x base ($0.45-$0.90).

#### Quality Rubric

**Mode-aware:** For photorealistic images, apply the full rubric. For illustrations, abstract art, or comics, apply only CRITICAL checks plus physical accuracy checks (phantom objects, impossible connections). Skip skin/face/saturation/AI aesthetic checks for non-photorealistic styles.

##### CRITICAL Failures (auto-reject)

Any single CRITICAL failure means immediate rejection:

- Extra, missing, or deformed limbs or hands
- Grotesque facial distortion
- Visible garbled text artifacts
- Gross anatomical impossibility
- Image corruption or rendering artifacts
- Completely wrong subject (asked for a boiler, got a landscape)
- **Phantom objects** — limbs, pipes, wires, tools, or objects that appear from nowhere with no logical source or connection

##### MAJOR Warnings

**Fine Detail & Realism (THE KEY CHECKS — this is where AI falls down):**

- **Unrealistic object details** — pipes that don't connect properly, tools with wrong shapes/proportions, equipment that couldn't physically work, mechanical parts that make no sense
- **Impossible physical connections** — things joined at wrong angles, pipes going through walls illogically, wires connected to nothing, hoses with no source/destination
- **Wrong material textures** — copper that doesn't look like copper, plastic that looks like metal, wood grain that's too uniform, surfaces that are too smooth/perfect for the material
- **Scale inconsistencies** — objects that are wrong size relative to each other (e.g., a wrench bigger than a boiler, screws the size of fists)
- **Missing expected details** — a boiler with no pressure gauge, a toolbox with featureless tools, a kitchen with no handles on cabinets
- **Physically impossible arrangements** — objects floating, defying gravity, balanced impossibly, overlapping through each other

**General AI Tells:**

- Uncanny valley faces (waxy, dead eyes)
- Plastic/airbrushed skin with zero texture
- Oversaturated/HDR look
- Inconsistent lighting/shadows (light from contradictory directions)
- Background anomalies (morphing objects, impossible geometry)
- Generic AI aesthetic (too clean, too perfect, no authentic character)

##### MINOR Notes (don't reject, but note for improvement)

- Slightly unrealistic textures that aren't obviously wrong
- Minor composition issues
- Subtle color cast differences from intent

#### Decision Logic

```
Any CRITICAL failure           → REJECT
2+ MAJOR warnings              → REJECT
1 MAJOR warning + attempts remain → REJECT (worth improving)
1 MAJOR warning + final attempt   → ACCEPT WITH CAVEAT
0 CRITICAL + 0-1 MAJOR        → ACCEPT
```

#### Fine-Detail Verification Instructions

When evaluating an image, you MUST zoom in mentally on every distinct object/element and ask:

1. **"Does this look exactly like the real thing?"** — pipes, tools, equipment, furniture, etc.
2. **"Are all connections physically logical?"** — where do pipes go, what are wires attached to, do joints make sense?
3. **"Is everything the right scale relative to everything else?"**
4. **"Are there any phantom objects that shouldn't be there?"** — extra limbs, mystery pipes, floating elements
5. **"Would a professional in this field (plumber, electrician, builder) spot something wrong immediately?"**

This is the MOST IMPORTANT part of verification. General AI detection (smooth skin, weird lighting) matters less than getting the physical details right.

#### Prompt Modification Guide

When an image is rejected, modify the prompt to fix the specific issues found:

| Issue Found | How to Fix the Prompt |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Phantom objects/limbs | Add explicit count constraints: "exactly X pipes", "only the tools mentioned"; add to negative_prompt: "no extra objects, no phantom limbs" |
| Unrealistic object details | Add hyper-specific descriptions of each object: material, texture, wear, connection points. E.g., "copper pipes with green patina at joints, compression fittings" |
| Wrong physical connections | Describe the connections explicitly: "pipe connects from boiler outlet valve down to floor-mounted manifold" |
| Wrong material textures | Specify material AND its characteristics: "brushed stainless steel with visible grain direction and fingerprint marks" rather than just "metal" |
| Scale inconsistencies | Add explicit size references: "standard 15mm copper pipe", "adjustable wrench approximately 30cm long" |
| Missing expected details | List the details explicitly in the prompt rather than relying on the model to know what a boiler/kitchen/workshop should contain |
| Deformed hands/extra limbs | Add "exactly two arms, five fingers per hand"; or hide hands (pockets, cropped) |
| Plastic skin / uncanny faces | Add "natural skin texture with pores"; add film stock reference; remove "perfect"/"beautiful" |
| Oversaturation | Add "natural color grading, muted tones"; add "shot on Kodak Portra 400" |
| Lighting inconsistency | Specify single light source with explicit direction |
| Generic AI aesthetic | Add film stock imperfections; reference specific photography style |

#### Meta-Strategy Across Attempts

- **Attempt 1**: Original prompt (with enhanced detail guidance from the prompting rules above)
- **Attempt 2**: Original + specific fixes for issues found + more explicit object descriptions + strengthened anti-AI directives
- **Attempt 3**: Simplified composition (fewer objects, simpler scene) + all previous fixes + maximum detail on remaining elements

#### When All Attempts Fail

If all 3 attempts produce rejected images, present the user with three options:
1. **Try a fundamentally different approach** — different angle, composition, or style
2. **Accept the best attempt** — show all three and let the user pick
3. **Abandon** — move on without an image

### 6. Show Results

Display the saved file path to the user and show the image with `view_image` when a visual preview is useful.

## Replicate API Fallback

If Google Gemini API fails (rate limits, timeouts, or unavailability), use the Replicate API as a fallback.

### Replicate API Token
```
${REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}
```

### Fallback Implementation

When Gemini fails, call the Replicate API:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/google/nano-banana-pro/predictions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": {
      "prompt": "YOUR_PROMPT_HERE",
      "resolution": "2K",
      "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
      "output_format": "jpg",
      "safety_filter_level": "block_only_high"
    }
  }'
```

### Polling for Replicate Results

Replicate is asynchronous - it returns a prediction ID immediately. Poll the status endpoint:

```bash
curl -s https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/PREDICTION_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}"
```

Check the `status` field:
- `starting` or `processing` - Keep polling (wait 1-2 seconds between polls)
- `succeeded` - Image is ready in the `output` field (URL to download)
- `failed` - Check `error` field for details
- `canceled` - Generation was canceled

### Downloading from Replicate

Once succeeded, download the image from the URL in the `output` field:
```bash
curl -s -o generated-image.jpg "OUTPUT_URL_FROM_REPLICATE"
```

### Fallback Decision Logic

Use the Replicate fallback when Gemini returns:
- HTTP 429 (Rate limit exceeded)
- HTTP 500/503 (Service unavailable)
- HTTP 504 (Gateway timeout)
- Empty or malformed response
- No image data in response
- Network timeout

### Key Differences Between APIs

| Aspect | Google Gemini (Primary) | Replicate (Fallback) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Response | Synchronous (waits for result) | Async polling |
| Output | Base64 inline data | URL to download |
| Format | Returns PNG by default | Configurable (jpg/png) |
| Resolution | Specify in prompt text | `resolution` param (1K/2K/4K) |
| Aspect ratio | Specify in prompt text | `aspect_ratio` param |
| Cost | Free tier available | $0.15-$0.30 per image |

### Prompt Adaptation for Replicate

Replicate supports structured parameters, so you can use JSON prompts with explicit settings:

```bash
# Replicate supports these parameters directly:
{
  "input": {
    "prompt": "A sunset over mountains",
    "resolution": "4K",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "output_format": "jpg"
  }
}
```

## Example Prompts for Websites

**Hero Images (Photorealistic):**
- "professional photography of modern office space with diverse team collaborating, anatomically correct proportions, natural lighting from large windows, authentic expressions, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 24mm f/2.8 lens, slight natural grain, no text, no words, photojournalistic style, real workplace environment, not AI generated"

## Error Handling

**Use Replicate API as fallback when Google Gemini fails. Never use other models (FLUX, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E).**

### Error Handling Flow

```
1. Try Google Gemini API (gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview)
   ↓ Success → Continue to quality verification
   ↓ Failure → Check error type

2. If retriable error (rate limit, timeout, unavailable):
   → Try Replicate API (google/nano-banana-pro)
   ↓ Success → Continue to quality verification
   ↓ Failure → Report to user

3. Quality verification loop:
   → Read saved image, evaluate against rubric
   → If ACCEPT → Done
   → If REJECT + attempts remain → Modify prompt, retry from step 1
   → If REJECT + no attempts remain → Offer user options

4. If non-retriable error (invalid prompt, safety filter):
   → Report to user, suggest prompt modification
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Error | Primary Action | Fallback |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **HTTP 429 Rate limit** | Wait 30s, retry Gemini | Use Replicate API |
| **HTTP 503/504 Timeout** | Retry once | Use Replicate API |
| **Service unavailable** | -- | Use Replicate API |
| **Safety filter rejection** | Adjust prompt | Adjust prompt (same for both) |
| **Empty/malformed response** | -- | Use Replicate API |
| **Network timeout** | -- | Use Replicate API |
| **Save location issues** | Fix directory | Same fix needed |
| **Quality verification failure** | Modify prompt based on specific issues found, retry | Same |
| **Both APIs fail** | Report to user | Ask how to proceed |

### When NOT to Fallback

- Safety filter rejections (prompt needs modification, not a different API)
- Invalid prompt format (fix the prompt)
- Authentication errors (fix API keys)
- User explicitly cancels

## Tips for Best Results

### General Guidelines
1. Be specific about style, mood, and composition
2. Include lighting details (e.g., "golden hour", "studio lighting")
3. **NEVER include text/words in images** - AI-generated text looks fake; add text separately using design tools
4. Use higher resolutions (4K) for detailed images or large prints
5. Use PNG format if you need transparency or maximum quality
6. For website images, optimize aspect ratio for the use case (16:9 for heroes, 1:1 for avatars, etc.)
7. Consider web performance - use 1K or 2K for web, save 4K for special cases

### Creating Photorealistic, Non-AI-Looking Images

**IMPORTANT**: To avoid common AI artifacts (like extra fingers, unrealistic proportions, or overly smooth/plastic appearance):

**1. Photography Keywords** - Add these to make images look like real photos:
   - "professional photography", "DSLR camera", "shot on Canon EOS R5"
   - "natural lighting", "authentic", "realistic imperfections"
   - Specific camera settings: "f/2.8", "50mm lens", "ISO 400", "natural grain"
   - "documentary style", "candid shot", "photojournalism"

**2. Anti-AI Phrases** - Include these to reduce AI artifacts:
   - "anatomically correct", "realistic proportions", "natural human anatomy"
   - "real photograph", "not AI generated", "authentic photography"
   - "film photography", "shot on 35mm film", "analog photography"
   - "natural skin texture", "realistic details", "photorealistic"

**3. Avoid Generic AI Terms** - Don't use:
   - ❌ "highly detailed", "trending on artstation", "unreal engine"
   - ❌ "perfect", "flawless", "stunning", "breathtaking"
   - ❌ "digital art", "concept art" (unless you actually want digital art)
   - ❌ Overly generic descriptions without specific details

**4. Specify Realistic Details**:
   - Instead of: "beautiful person"
   - Use: "person with natural skin texture, slight blemishes, authentic expression, photographed in natural daylight"

   - Instead of: "amazing landscape"
   - Use: "landscape photograph taken during golden hour, natural colors, slight atmospheric haze, shot on full-frame DSLR"

**5. For People/Portraits** (to avoid extra limbs, wrong proportions):
   - ALWAYS specify: "anatomically correct", "two hands visible", "natural proportions"
   - Add: "professional portrait photography", "authentic human features"
   - Include: "natural skin texture with pores and subtle imperfections"
   - Example: "professional headshot of a business person, anatomically correct, natural proportions, two hands visible, authentic facial features, slight skin texture, shot on Canon 5D Mark IV with 85mm f/1.8 lens"

**6. Lighting Makes It Real**:
   - Be very specific: "soft window light from the left", "golden hour backlighting", "overcast natural light"
   - Avoid: "perfect lighting", "studio lighting" (unless you want studio look)
   - Add natural imperfections: "slight shadow under nose", "subtle rim light", "natural fall-off"

**7. Never Include Text/Typography**:
   - ALWAYS add to prompt: "no text, no words, no letters, no typography, no signs"
   - AI-generated text is an instant giveaway of AI generation
   - Remove any mention of: signs, labels, billboards, posters, text overlays, captions
   - If you need text on the image, add it after generation using Photoshop, Figma, or other design tools
   - Examples to avoid: ❌ "billboard with company name", ❌ "sign saying 'open'", ❌ "text overlay"

**Example Transformation**:

❌ **Bad (AI-looking)**: "beautiful woman in office"

✅ **Good (photorealistic)**: "professional photography of a business woman in modern office, anatomically correct proportions, natural skin texture with subtle pores, authentic expression, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 50mm f/2.8 lens, natural window lighting from right side, slight shadows, no text, no words, no typography, realistic details, photojournalistic style, not AI generated"

## JSON Prompting (Required for All Images)

**IMPORTANT: Always use JSON prompts for ALL image generations.** JSON prompts provide structured information that makes outputs more repeatable and gives you direct control over subject, style, composition, and lighting. They help avoid the model's default aesthetic and produce consistent, high-quality results.

### Why JSON for Everything

- **Consistency**: Every image follows the same structured approach
- **Control**: Direct control over every aspect of the image
- **No defaults**: Escape the model's default "beautiful, warm, rustic" look
- **Reproducibility**: Easy to tweak and iterate on prompts
- **Quality**: More detailed prompts = better results

### JSON Template Structure

Use this template as your starting point for ALL image generations. Adapt the fields to your subject:

```json
{
  "subject": {
    "main": "Description of the main subject",
    "details": {
      "appearance": "Specific visual details",
      "position": "Where/how positioned",

### Image to JSON Conversion

Use this system prompt with Gemini 3 Pro (or another capable vision model) to convert a reference image into a JSON prompt:

```
You are an expert prompt engineer for Nano Banana Pro. Your task is to convert the user's description into a sophisticated, EXTREMELY DETAILED JSON prompt. You must output a single valid JSON object.

### JSON STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
1. **Dynamic Fields**: Add new fields that capture specific details about the subject (e.g., "plating_style" for food, "architecture_era" for buildings).
2. **Remove Irrelevant Fields**: Do NOT include fields that don't apply. If the subject is a stove, do not include "hair", "skin", or "pose".
3. **Subject Specificity**:
   - **For People**: Keep subject, face, skin, hair, clothing structure.
   - **For Non-Humans**: Create a structure that fits the object.
4. **Standard Fields**: Always include "constraints" (with "must_keep" and "avoid" lists) and "negative_prompt".

### AESTHETIC GOALS:
- **Medium Specificity**: If the user asks for a specific style (e.g. "oil painting"), describe the brushwork, canvas texture, and drying cracks.
- **Lighting**: Be precise (soft, hard, volumetric, golden hour, studio, rim lighting).
- **Camera**: (focal length, depth of field) - ONLY if the style requires photorealism.

Return ONLY the raw JSON string.
```

### Creating Variations from JSON

Prefix your JSON prompt with instructions to generate variations while maintaining the same aesthetic:

**Basic variation:**
```
Generate a new image with SIGNIFICANTLY different nouns, objects, color palette and pose compared to the JSON below. CRITICAL: Strictly preserve the original 'vibe', 'aesthetic', and 'mood'. The result should look like a distinct image from the same artistic series.

[YOUR JSON PROMPT HERE]
```

**Steered variation:**
```
Additional Instruction: Make it night time

Generate a new image with SIGNIFICANTLY different nouns, objects, color palette and pose compared to the JSON below. CRITICAL: Strictly preserve the original 'vibe', 'aesthetic', and 'mood'. The result should look like a distinct image from the same artistic series.

[YOUR JSON PROMPT HERE]
```

### Quick Reference: Essential JSON Fields

For ANY image, always include these minimum fields:

```json
{
  "subject": { "main": "..." },
  "photography": {
    "lighting": { "type": "...", "source": "..." },
    "camera_gear": { "lens": "...", "aperture": "..." }
  },
  "aesthetic_fidelity": { "medium": "...", "vibe": "..." },
  "constraints": { "must_keep": [...], "avoid": [...] },
  "negative_prompt": [...]
}
```
