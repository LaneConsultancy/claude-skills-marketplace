name: demo-builder
description: "Build an impressive demo website (homepage + sample service/location pages) for client presentations and feedback. Generates a brief compatible with /website-builder for full build continuation. Triggers: 'build demo', 'demo site', 'client demo', 'demo website', 'pitch site', 'sample site'."

# Demo Builder Skill

**You are a coordinator. You do NOT write code yourself. You orchestrate agents and enforce quality gates.**

This skill builds an impressive but reduced-scope demo site to show clients what you can deliver. When the client approves, `/website-builder` continues the full build using the same brief and artifacts.

## DEFAULT MODEL

**This skill runs on Sonnet.** Before invoking `/demo-builder`, switch to Sonnet with `/model sonnet` if not already active.

**All sub-agents spawned by this skill MUST use `model: "sonnet"` unless explicitly overridden.** Only escalate to `model: "opus"` if a specific agent is producing inadequate results after a retry on Sonnet.

## AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE

**After Phase 0 brief confirmation, execute ALL remaining phases (1-4) without stopping for user input.**

Rules:
1. When a gate **PASSES** -> immediately begin the next phase. Do not summarize, do not ask "shall I proceed?", do not pause.
2. When a gate **FAILS** -> spawn agents to fix the issues, re-run the gate, and continue when it passes. Do NOT escalate to the user unless stuck.
3. Never ask "shall I proceed?" or "ready for the next phase?" after Phase 0. Just do it.
4. If stuck after 2 fix attempts on the same gate, document the blocker and skip to the next phase if possible.

---

## Phase 0: Gather Requirements

Before any research or coding, you need a specification. There are two paths:

### Step 0.0: Check for Existing Spec
Read `/spec/brief.md`. If it exists and contains filled-in business information (not just the template), **skip to Phase 1**.

### Step 0.1: Interview the User (if no spec exists)
If no spec exists, interview the user using `AskUserQuestion` in 5 grouped rounds. Use smart defaults so users can breeze through quickly.

**Round 1 - Business Basics:**
- Business name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Physical address (if applicable)

**Round 2 - What You Do:**
- Business description (2-3 sentences)
- Unique selling points (what makes you different?)
- Target audience (homeowners, businesses, etc.)
- Years in business

**Round 3 - Services & Locations:**
- List of ALL services offered (full list -- needed for brief compatibility with /website-builder)
- List of ALL locations/areas served (full list)
- **Demo selection**: "For the demo, I'll build 2-3 representative service pages and 2-3 location pages. Which services and locations are most important to showcase first?" (Default: first 2-3 of each list)

**Round 4 - Design & Tech:**
- Design aesthetic -- present these options:
  - **Premium Agency** (high-end feel -- luxury fonts, spring animations, layered depth) -- default
  - **Clean Editorial** (minimal, Notion/Linear inspired -- warm monochrome, serif contrast, flat grids)
  - **Bold Industrial** (raw, mechanical -- Swiss typography, rigid grids, utilitarian)
  - **Pick for me** -- auto-select based on business type
- Brand colors (or "pick for me" -- default)
- Reference websites for inspiration (optional)
- Tech stack -- default: Next.js + ShadCN + Tailwind CSS
- Logo file path (optional, can add later)

**Round 5 - Content & Features:**
- Competitor URLs (for research -- optional but recommended)
- Testimonials (real ones, or "generate placeholders")
- Accreditations/certifications
- Special features -- default: contact form + Google Maps embed

### Step 0.2: Generate the Brief
Write `/spec/brief.md` from the interview answers using the SPEC_TEMPLATE format. Fill in all sections with the gathered information. Use smart defaults for anything the user skipped.

Include a "Design Aesthetic" field recording the chosen style and its corresponding taste-skill variant.

**Add the `## Demo Build Scope` section at the bottom** listing which pages are included in the demo and which are deferred to the full build.

### GATE 0: Brief Confirmation
Present a summary of the generated brief to the user and ask them to confirm before proceeding. Use `AskUserQuestion` with options like "Looks good, proceed" / "I need to change something".

**If the user wants changes, update the brief and re-confirm.**

---

## CRITICAL: Content Is Not Optional

The whole point of a demo is to impress the client. Placeholder content will NOT impress anyone.

**Content research and writing happens BEFORE coding. This is non-negotiable.**

---

## CRITICAL: Quality Gates Are Non-Negotiable

This is a pitch site. Every page must look premium. Quality gates exist to ensure this.

**You MUST enforce quality gates at every phase. This is not optional.**

---

## DESIGN STANDARDS

**The demo MUST look like premium agency work. These rules prevent generic-looking output.**

### Hero Sections
- Hero text MUST be concise: headline (6-10 words max) + subheadline (1-2 short sentences) + CTA button
- NEVER dump a full paragraph into the hero. Long descriptions belong BELOW the fold.
- Hero should create visual impact through typography scale, imagery, and whitespace -- not word count.
- Hero headline should use a large, distinctive display font size (e.g., text-5xl/6xl on desktop, text-3xl/4xl on mobile).

### Typography Hierarchy
- There MUST be clear visual distinction between H1, H2, H3, and body text (size, weight, AND spacing)
- H1 should be dramatically larger than body text, not just slightly bigger
- Use font weight contrast (bold headings, regular body) not just size
- Line height and letter spacing matter -- body text needs comfortable reading line-height (1.6-1.8)

### Content Layout (Anti-Wall-of-Text)
- Break long content into scannable sections with: subheadings, bullet points, icons, cards, or grid layouts
- No section should present more than 3-4 sentences as a continuous block without a visual break
- Use cards, grids, or columns to present service lists, features, and benefits -- NOT sequential paragraphs
- Alternate section layouts (e.g., text-left/image-right, then image-left/text-right, then full-width cards)

### Visual Interest
- Every page needs visual rhythm: vary section backgrounds (white, light grey, brand-tinted, dark)
- Use the brand's accent color intentionally for CTAs, highlights, and key elements -- not everywhere
- Add subtle depth: shadows on cards, hover states on interactive elements, border treatments
- Icons or images should accompany service/feature lists, not just text

### Spacing
- Generous whitespace between sections (py-16 to py-24, not py-4 to py-8)
- Consistent internal padding on cards and containers
- Mobile spacing can be tighter but should still breathe

### What NOT to Do
- DO NOT create heroes with 3+ sentences of text
- DO NOT use the same layout pattern for every section on a page
- DO NOT present services/features as a plain text list -- use cards or a grid
- DO NOT use identical section backgrounds throughout the page
- DO NOT use generic/safe fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial) unless the brief specifically requests them

---

## TASTE-SKILL & ANTI-SLOP INTEGRATION

Based on the design aesthetic chosen in Phase 0, include these skills in ALL agent prompts:

**Always include in EVERY coder agent prompt:**
- `/taste-skill` -- framework safety rules (RSC, Tailwind version guards, dependency verification, animation performance)
- `/output-skill` -- prevents truncated code and placeholder comments
- `/unslop-react-design` -- bans generic AI layout patterns, visual defaults, typography cliches, stock copy, and component templates. Prevents the demo from looking like every other AI-generated site.

**Always include in EVERY copywriter agent prompt:**
- `/unslop-writing` -- bans AI writing defaults (stock phrases, structural patterns, tonal habits, word-level cliches). Ensures content sounds human, not like a median of all AI writing.

**Variant skill (based on brief's Design Aesthetic):**

| Aesthetic | Variant Skill | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Premium Agency | `/soft-skill` | Default. Three sub-vibes: Ethereal Glass, Editorial Luxury, Soft Structuralism |
| Clean Editorial | `/minimalist-skill` | Warm monochrome, serif/sans contrast, flat bento grids |
| Bold Industrial | `/brutalist-skill` | Swiss print or CRT terminal mode |

**Dial overrides for demo sites:**
- DESIGN_VARIANCE: 5-6 (professional, not experimental)
- MOTION_INTENSITY: 3-4 (subtle polish, reduces animation-related gate failures)
- VISUAL_DENSITY: 4 (keep as default)

**How to include in coder prompts:**
"Use the `/taste-skill`, `/output-skill`, and `/unslop-react-design` skills. Also use the `/[variant]-skill` for the design aesthetic. Set DESIGN_VARIANCE to 5 and MOTION_INTENSITY to 3."

**How to include in copywriter prompts:**
"Use the `/unslop-writing` skill. Avoid all banned phrases, structural patterns, and tonal habits listed in that skill."

---

## Pre-Flight Checks (BEFORE ANY CODING)

### 1. Verify Browser Tools
```
FIRST, verify you can use browser automation:
- Try to navigate to any URL
- Try to take a screenshot
- If either fails: STOP and tell user to fix browser tools
```

**If browser tools don't work, DO NOT proceed with website building.**

### 2. Start Dev Server
After the first coder creates the initial project:
```
npm run dev
```
Verify it's accessible at localhost:3000 (or configured port).

### 3. Take Initial Screenshot
Navigate to localhost and take a screenshot. This confirms tools work.

---

## Build Process (With Mandatory Quality Gates)

### Phase 1: Quick Research & Content (BEFORE ANY CODING)

**This phase is MANDATORY. Do not skip to coding.**

#### Step 1.1: Light Market Research
Spawn `market-research` agent with:
```
Research content requirements for a [BUSINESS TYPE] website targeting [LOCATIONS].

ABBREVIATED SCOPE (demo build):
1. Analyze 2-3 competitor URLs from the brief
2. For the top 3 primary keywords, check what content is ranking
3. Note word count ranges and required sections

OUTPUT:
Create /spec/content-requirements.md with:
- Minimum word count per page type (homepage, service, location)
- Required content sections per page type
- Key content gaps competitors are missing
```

#### Step 1.2: Write Content for Demo Pages (parallel with 1.3)
Spawn `copywriter` agent with:
```
Write content for the demo pages defined in the brief.

INPUTS:
- Read /spec/brief.md for business info, services, locations
- Read /spec/content-requirements.md for word count minimums
- Check the "Demo Build Scope" section for which pages to write

IMPORTANT: Use the `/unslop-writing` skill. Follow ALL its rules:
- Never use banned phrases ("In today's landscape", "Let's dive in", "Here's the thing", "At its core", etc.)
- Never use banned structural patterns (broad sweeping opener, "Final thoughts" section, rhetorical question transitions)
- Never use banned tonal patterns (breathless enthusiasm, false-authority voice, hedging every claim)
- Never use banned words (landscape, paradigm, leverage, robust, seamless, ecosystem, delve, navigate, unlock)
- Write like a specific human with a specific voice — not like a median of all writing on the internet

PAGES TO WRITE:
- homepage.md (full effort)
- about.md (full effort)
- contact.md (contact info + form description)
- services/[demo-service-1].md (full effort)
- services/[demo-service-2].md (full effort)
- services/[demo-service-3].md (full effort, if 3 selected)
- locations/[demo-location-1].md (full effort)
- locations/[demo-location-2].md (full effort)
- locations/[demo-location-3].md (full effort, if 3 selected)

NO matrix page content needed.

Each file should contain:
- Meta title
- Meta description
- H1
- Full page content with H2/H3 structure
- CTA text

QUALITY: This is a client pitch. Content must be compelling and professional.
```

#### Step 1.3: Generate Images (parallel with 1.2)
Spawn `art-director` agent with:
```
Generate images for the demo website based on the brief.

INPUTS:
- Read /spec/brief.md for business info, style direction, and brand

IMAGES TO GENERATE:
1. Homepage hero image (1920x1080)
2. Service page images (one per demo service, 1200x800)
3. About page image (1200x800)

OUTPUT:
Save to /public/images/ with clear naming.
Create /spec/image-manifest.md listing all images with alt text.
```

**GATE 1 (Combined)**: Verify ALL content files exist for demo pages, meet word counts, no placeholder text, AND images exist and are professional. If any fail, re-spawn the appropriate agent to fix. Proceed when all pass.

---

### Phase 2: Foundation + Homepage

#### Step 2.1: Project Setup + Homepage
Spawn coder agent(s) for:
- Next.js project creation, dependencies, base layout
- Navigation with links to all demo pages
- Footer with business info
- Full homepage build with real content from `/spec/content/homepage.md`

**IMPORTANT: Include in the coder prompt:**
- "Use the `/taste-skill`, `/output-skill`, `/unslop-react-design`, and `/[VARIANT]-skill` (from the brief's Design Aesthetic). Set DESIGN_VARIANCE to 5 and MOTION_INTENSITY to 3."
- "Read `/spec/brief.md` for brand colors, style direction, and typography preferences"
- "Follow the Design Standards -- especially hero section and typography rules"
- "Follow ALL `/unslop-react-design` rules -- no default SaaS stack layout, no gradient blobs, no frosted glass cards, no stock copy patterns, no Inter font, no 3-column pricing cards"
- "Choose a distinctive heading font that matches the style direction (NOT Inter, Roboto, or Arial)"
- "Use real content from `/spec/content/homepage.md` -- NO placeholder text"

#### GATE 2: Homepage Quality Check
After coder completes:
- Start dev server if not running
- Spawn quality-check agent
- Quality check MUST screenshot at 375px, 768px, 1440px
- Quality check MUST verify real content is present
- **The homepage is the most important page for the demo. It must be impressive.**
- If quality check returns NOT READY with Critical issues: spawn coder agent(s) to fix, re-run quality-check. Proceed when it passes.

---

### Phase 3: Sample Pages + Light Polish

#### Step 3.1: Build Remaining Demo Pages
Spawn coder agent(s) for:
- About page (with content from `/spec/content/about.md`)
- Contact page (with content from `/spec/content/contact.md`)
- 2-3 service pages (with content from `/spec/content/services/`)
- 2-3 location pages (with content from `/spec/content/locations/`)

**CRITICAL**: All pages use real content from `/spec/content/`. NO placeholder text.
**CRITICAL**: Service and location pages must NOT be walls of text -- use cards, grids, icons, alternating layouts.
Coders MUST use `/taste-skill`, `/output-skill`, `/unslop-react-design`, and the variant skill.
**CRITICAL**: Follow ALL `/unslop-react-design` bans -- no stock layout patterns, no generic visual defaults, no cliche copy patterns.

#### Step 3.2: Light Polish
Same or new coder agent adds:
- Subtle animations (conservative -- MOTION_INTENSITY: 3)
- Hover states on cards and buttons
- Smooth transitions
- Mobile navigation (hamburger menu)

No separate gate between pages and polish -- tested together in Phase 4.

---

### Phase 4: Production Build + Final Quality Check

#### Step 4.1: Basic SEO
Spawn `seo-onpage` agent for:
- Meta tags on all demo pages (from content files)
- Basic LocalBusiness structured data
- No sitemap needed for demo

#### Step 4.2: Production Build
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Fix any build errors
3. Run `npm run start` (production server)

#### Step 4.3: Final Quality Check
Spawn quality-check agent for comprehensive review:

```
You are checking if this DEMO SITE is ready to show a client.

REMEMBER:
- Default to FAIL, not pass
- You're judging if this will win a paying client
- List EVERY issue, not just a few
- Compare to professional sites (Apple, Stripe, Linear)
- If ANY doubt, verdict is NOT READY

TEST THESE PAGES:
- Homepage
- About page
- Contact page
- 1 service page
- 1 location page

AT THESE VIEWPORTS:
- 375px (mobile)
- 768px (tablet)
- 1440px (desktop)

CHECKS:
- Real content on every page (no placeholders)
- No console errors
- No failed network resources
- Animation multi-screenshot test (immediately, after 2s, after scroll)
- All images load correctly
- Navigation works on all pages
- Mobile menu works

DESIGN VERIFICATION:
- Hero: concise (headline + subheadline + CTA) not wall of text
- Typography: clear visual hierarchy
- Layout variety: alternating section layouts
- Spacing: generous whitespace between sections
- Visual rhythm: varying section backgrounds

ANTI-SLOP DESIGN CHECK (from /unslop-react-design):
- Does the layout follow the generic SaaS stack (hero -> proof strip -> features -> pricing -> testimonials -> CTA)? = NOT READY
- Are there radial glows, blurred orbs, or gradient haze behind the hero? = NOT READY
- Are there frosted glass cards or translucent panels? = NOT READY
- Is the heading font Inter/Roboto/Arial without explicit brief justification? = NOT READY
- Stock copy patterns: "Trusted by...", "Built for...", "Everything you need", "Get Started"? = NOT READY
- Does it look like every other AI-generated website? = NOT READY

ANTI-SLOP CONTENT CHECK (from /unslop-writing):
- Content starts with "In today's landscape/world"? = NOT READY
- Uses "Let's dive in", "Here's the thing", "At its core"? = NOT READY
- Uses "seamless", "robust", "leverage", "ecosystem", "delve"? = NOT READY
- Ends with "Final thoughts" or "Key takeaways"? = NOT READY
- Feels like generic AI writing rather than a specific human voice? = NOT READY

WEB DESIGN PREMIUM-FEEL CHECK (any = NOT READY):
Halo-effect destroyers from `~/.Codex/knowledgebase/website-design/checklist.md` (canonical gate). See `~/.Codex/knowledgebase/website-design/applying-to-skills.md` for context.
- Hero fails 50ms blink test — within half a second, viewer cannot tell what the business is and why it matters; one feeling, not a buffet [KB: principles.md → Halo Effect]
- Stock-photo cliches — boardroom high-fives, group-around-laptop, faceless suits [KB: anti-patterns.md]
- No "star of the show" — nothing anchors the eye long enough to convert attention [KB: principles.md]
- All text at 100% opacity — no opacity hierarchy (anchor 100, body 87, meta 60) [KB: principles.md]
- No felt hover states on interactive elements — buttons/cards feel dead [KB: checklist.md]
- Hidden pricing or about-page-as-CV (founder bio instead of trust-building) [KB: anti-patterns.md]

The Three Questions:
1. Does this look like premium agency work? [YES/NO]
2. Would a client be impressed enough to pay for a full site? [YES/NO]
3. Does this compete with the best? [YES/NO]

If ANY answer is NO, verdict is NOT READY.
```

**GATE 4**: Must pass final quality check. If critical issues, fix and re-run (max 2 attempts). When it passes, proceed to completion.

---

## Completion & Handoff

When the final quality check passes, output:

```
DEMO COMPLETE
```

Then present the handoff summary to the user:

```markdown
## Demo Site Ready for Client Presentation

### What was built:
- Homepage
- About page
- Contact page
- [N] service pages: [list them]
- [N] location pages: [list them]

### Artifacts saved for full build:
- /spec/brief.md (complete specification with ALL services and locations)
- /spec/content/ (content for demo pages -- reusable)
- /spec/content-requirements.md (market research -- reusable)
- /spec/image-manifest.md (image inventory)
- Generated images in /public/images/
- Complete codebase with layout, components, and styles

### To continue with the full build:
Run `/website-builder` in this project directory.

It will:
1. Detect the existing brief and skip the interview
2. Extend content research to cover ALL pages
3. Write content for remaining service + location pages
4. Build ALL matrix pages (service x location combinations)
5. Full SEO implementation with sitemap
6. Comprehensive quality gates at every phase

### What the full build adds:
- [remaining services] service pages
- [remaining locations] location pages
- [total] matrix pages for local SEO ([services] x [locations])
- Complete sitemap and internal linking
- Extended SEO optimization
- Exhaustive multi-phase quality gates
```

---

## Red Flags That Require Immediate Quality Check

If a coder mentions ANY of these, spawn quality-check immediately:
- "animation" / "opacity" / "transition" / "fadeIn"
- "should work" (without verification)
- Any console error, even "minor"
- "done" without mentioning screenshots
- Hero with more than 2 sentences of body text
- All sections using the same background color
- Services listed as paragraphs instead of cards/grid
- Coder uses Inter font, gradient blobs, frosted glass cards, or "Trusted by" copy (unslop violations)
- Layout follows generic hero -> proof strip -> features -> pricing -> testimonials -> CTA stack
- CTA text is "Get Started", "Book a Demo", or "Start Free Trial" (stock copy from unslop-react-design)

---

## Content Red Flags (STOP and FIX immediately)

If you see ANY of these, STOP and fix content first:
- "Lorem ipsum" or placeholder text anywhere
- "TODO", "FIXME", "[INSERT]", "[PLACEHOLDER]" in content
- Coder saying "I'll add content later"
- Pages with thin content that doesn't match spec
- Generic content without business name or location references

**This is a pitch site. Content shortcuts are NOT acceptable.**

---

## Anti-Sycophancy Reminder

The quality-check agent may try to be "helpful" by approving mediocre work.

If a quality check comes back positive but you have doubts:
1. Ask for a more critical re-evaluation
2. Request specific comparison to professional sites
3. Ask "Would a client be impressed enough to pay for a full build?"

**Do not trust rubber-stamp approvals. Challenge them if needed.**
