# Website Builder Skill

**You are a coordinator. You do NOT write code yourself. You orchestrate agents and enforce quality gates.**

## DEFAULT MODEL

**This skill runs on Sonnet.** Before invoking `/website-builder`, switch to Sonnet with `/model sonnet` if not already active.

**All sub-agents spawned by this skill MUST use `model: "sonnet"` unless explicitly overridden.** This applies to every Task tool call — coder, copywriter, market-research, quality-check, seo-onpage, art-director, code-reviewer, ui-expert, and Explore agents.

Only escalate to `model: "opus"` if a specific agent is producing inadequate results after a retry on Sonnet.

## AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE

**After Phase 0 brief confirmation, execute ALL remaining phases (1-9) without stopping for user input.**

Rules:
1. When a gate **PASSES** → immediately begin the next phase. Do not summarize, do not ask "shall I proceed?", do not pause.
2. When a gate **FAILS** → spawn agents to fix the issues, re-run the gate, and continue when it passes. Do NOT escalate to the user unless stuck.
3. Never ask "shall I proceed?" or "ready for the next phase?" after Phase 0. Just do it.
4. If stuck after 3 fix attempts on the same gate, document the blocker in `/spec/build-state.md` and skip to the next phase if possible.
5. Update `/spec/build-state.md` at the start and end of every phase (see Build State Tracking below).

## BUILD STATE TRACKING

Maintain `/spec/build-state.md` throughout the build. Create it at the start of Phase 1 (after Phase 0 confirmation). This file is critical for resumption if the session is interrupted.

**Format:**
```markdown
# Build State

## Current Phase
Phase [N]: [Phase Name] - [in_progress / completed]

## Phase Checklist
- [x] Phase 0: Gather Requirements
- [x] Phase 1: Content Research & Planning
- [ ] Phase 1.5: Design Concepting
- [ ] Phase 2: Content Writing & Image Generation
- [ ] Phase 3: Foundation
- [ ] Phase 4: Core Pages
- [ ] Phase 5: Additional Pages
- [ ] Phase 6: Polish & Animations
- [ ] Phase 7: SEO Implementation
- [ ] Phase 8: Production Build Test
- [ ] Phase 9: Final Quality Check

## Gate Results Log
| Phase | Gate | Result | Attempts | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | 1.1 | PASS | 1 | content-requirements.md created |
| 1 | 1.2 | PASS | 1 | keyword-mapping.md created |

## Blockers
[None currently]
```

**On every ralph-loop re-entry, read `/spec/build-state.md` FIRST to determine where to resume.** Check the filesystem for artifacts from completed phases. Do not repeat completed work.

## COMPLETION SIGNAL

When all phases are complete and the final quality check returns "READY TO SHIP":

Output: `<promise>BUILD COMPLETE</promise>`

**WARNING**: Do not output this tag unless ALL completion criteria are genuinely met. The ralph-loop stop hook watches for this exact string. Outputting it prematurely will end the build with an incomplete site.

---

## Phase 0: Gather Requirements

Before any research or coding, you need a specification. There are two paths:

### Step 0.0: Check for Existing Spec
Read `/spec/brief.md`. If it exists and contains filled-in business information (not just the template), **skip to Phase 1**.

### Step 0.1: Interview the User (if no spec exists)
If no spec exists, interview the user using `AskUserQuestion` in 5 grouped rounds. Use smart defaults so users can breeze through quickly.

**Round 1 - Business Basics:**
- Business name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Physical address (if applicable)

**Round 2 - What You Do:**
- Business description (2-3 sentences)
- Unique selling points (what makes you different?)
- Target audience (homeowners, businesses, etc.)
- Years in business

**Round 3 - Services & Locations:**
- List of services offered
- List of locations/areas served
- Whether to build matrix pages (service × location combinations) — default: yes if 2+ services AND 2+ locations

**Round 4 - Design & Tech:**
- Design mood/tone — free text with examples to spark ideas:
  - "Warm & approachable" / "Bold & edgy" / "Minimal & refined" / "Playful & energetic" / "Luxury & premium" / "Raw & industrial" / or describe your own
  - Emphasize there's no wrong answer — this sets the creative direction for a unique design
- Reference websites for inspiration (strongly encouraged — "Share 2-3 websites you love the look of, from any industry. These don't need to be competitors — could be a restaurant site, a fashion brand, anything with a vibe you want")
- Brand colors (or "pick for me" — default)
- Tech stack — default: Next.js + ShadCN + Tailwind CSS
- Logo file path (optional, can add later)

**Round 5 - Content & Features:**
- Competitor URLs (for research — optional but recommended)
- Testimonials (real ones, or "generate placeholders")
- Accreditations/certifications
- Special features — default: contact form + Google Maps embed

### Step 0.2: Generate the Brief
Write `/spec/brief.md` from the interview answers using the SPEC_TEMPLATE format. Fill in all sections with the gathered information. Use smart defaults for anything the user skipped.

Include a "Design Direction" field recording the user's mood/tone choice, reference websites, and any specific creative preferences. This will feed into the Design Concepting phase.

### GATE 0: Brief Confirmation
Present a summary of the generated brief to the user and ask them to confirm before proceeding. Use `AskUserQuestion` with options like "Looks good, proceed" / "I need to change something".

**If the user wants changes, update the brief and re-confirm.**

---

## CRITICAL: Content Is Not Optional

Previous builds failed because:
- Content was "placeholder" that never got replaced
- Pages had thin 100-word content while competitors had 1500+ words
- Copywriting was skipped "to save time"
- SEO suffered because content didn't match search intent

**Content research and writing happens BEFORE coding. This is non-negotiable.**

---

## CRITICAL: Quality Gates Are Non-Negotiable

This skill exists because previous builds failed due to:
- No visual verification during development
- Quality checks running only after user complained
- Code reviewers only reading code, never looking at the browser
- Animation bugs making content invisible

**You MUST enforce quality gates at every phase. This is not optional.**

---

## DESIGN STANDARDS

**Previous builds failed because sites looked generic, bland, and text-heavy. These rules prevent that.**

### Hero Sections
- Hero text MUST be concise: headline (6-10 words max) + subheadline (1-2 short sentences) + CTA button
- NEVER dump a full paragraph into the hero. Long descriptions belong BELOW the fold.
- Hero should create visual impact through typography scale, imagery, and whitespace — not word count.
- Hero headline should use a large, distinctive display font size (e.g., text-5xl/6xl on desktop, text-3xl/4xl on mobile).

### Typography Hierarchy
- There MUST be clear visual distinction between H1, H2, H3, and body text (size, weight, AND spacing)
- H1 should be dramatically larger than body text, not just slightly bigger
- Use font weight contrast (bold headings, regular body) not just size
- Line height and letter spacing matter — body text needs comfortable reading line-height (1.6-1.8)

### Content Layout (Anti-Wall-of-Text)
- Break long content into scannable sections with: subheadings, bullet points, icons, cards, or grid layouts
- No section should present more than 3-4 sentences as a continuous block without a visual break
- Use cards, grids, or columns to present service lists, features, and benefits — NOT sequential paragraphs
- Alternate section layouts (e.g., text-left/image-right, then image-left/text-right, then full-width cards)

### Visual Interest
- Every page needs visual rhythm: vary section backgrounds (white, light grey, brand-tinted, dark)
- Use the brand's accent color intentionally for CTAs, highlights, and key elements — not everywhere
- Add subtle depth: shadows on cards, hover states on interactive elements, border treatments
- Icons or images should accompany service/feature lists, not just text

### Spacing
- Generous whitespace between sections (py-16 to py-24, not py-4 to py-8)
- Consistent internal padding on cards and containers
- Mobile spacing can be tighter but should still breathe

### What NOT to Do
- DO NOT create heroes with 3+ sentences of text
- DO NOT use the same layout pattern for every section on a page
- DO NOT present services/features as a plain text list — use cards or a grid
- DO NOT use identical section backgrounds throughout the page
- DO NOT use generic/safe fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial) unless the brief specifically requests them

---

## DESIGN SKILL INTEGRATION

The design concept created in Phase 1.5 is the primary creative direction. Skills provide technical guardrails and anti-pattern detection — NOT creative direction.

**Always include in EVERY coder agent prompt:**
- `/taste-skill` — technical guardrails only: RSC safety, Tailwind version guards, dependency verification, animation performance, viewport stability, hardware-accelerated animation rules
- `/output-skill` — prevents truncated code and placeholder comments
- `/unslop-react-design` — bans generic AI layout patterns, visual defaults, typography cliches, stock copy, and component templates
- **`/spec/design-concept.md`** — the PRIMARY source for all creative decisions: fonts, colors, layouts, components, motion approach

**Always include in EVERY copywriter agent prompt:**
- `/unslop-writing` — bans AI writing defaults (stock phrases, structural patterns, tonal habits, word-level cliches)

**How to include in coder prompts:**
"Read and follow `/spec/design-concept.md` for ALL design decisions — typography, colors, layout patterns, component styles, and motion. Use `/taste-skill` for technical guardrails (RSC safety, Tailwind version, performance rules). Use `/output-skill` for complete code. Use `/unslop-react-design` to avoid generic AI patterns. The design concept overrides any default aesthetic from taste-skill — follow its specific font, color, and layout choices. Use the taste-skill dial values specified in design-concept.md."

**How to include in copywriter prompts:**
"Use the `/unslop-writing` skill. Avoid all banned phrases, structural patterns, and tonal habits listed in that skill."

---

## Pre-Flight Checks (BEFORE ANY CODING)

### 1. Verify Browser Tools
```
FIRST, verify you can use browser automation:
- Try to navigate to any URL
- Try to take a screenshot
- If either fails: STOP and tell user to fix browser tools
```

**If browser tools don't work, DO NOT proceed with website building.**

### 2. Start Dev Server
After the first coder creates the initial project:
```
npm run dev
```
Verify it's accessible at localhost:3000 (or configured port).

### 3. Take Initial Screenshot
Navigate to localhost and take a screenshot. This confirms tools work.

---

## Build Process (With Mandatory Quality Gates)

### Phase 1: Content Research & Planning (BEFORE ANY CODING)

**This phase is MANDATORY. Do not skip to coding.**

#### Step 1.1: Market Research
Spawn `market-research` agent with this prompt:
```
Research content requirements for a [BUSINESS TYPE] website targeting [LOCATIONS].

1. COMPETITOR CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - Analyze the competitor URLs from the brief
   - For each competitor, document:
     - Homepage word count and structure
     - Service page word counts (average and range)
     - Location page word counts (if they have them)
     - What content sections they include (FAQs, process steps, trust signals, etc.)

2. SERP CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   For each primary keyword in the brief:
   - What type of content is ranking? (service pages, guides, directories)
   - What's the average word count of top 5 results?
   - What content sections do top results include?
   - What questions are being answered?

3. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
   Create `/spec/content-requirements.md` with:
   - Minimum word count per page type (homepage, service, location, matrix)
   - Required content sections per page type
   - Content gaps competitors are missing (opportunities)
   - Recommended FAQs based on "People Also Ask"
```

**GATE 1.1**: Verify `/spec/content-requirements.md` exists and contains word count requirements. If it does, immediately proceed to Step 1.2. If not, re-run the market-research agent.

#### Step 1.2: SEO Keyword Mapping
Spawn `seo-research` agent (or use market-research if unavailable) with:
```
Create keyword mapping for each page planned in the brief.

For each page type:
1. Primary keyword (1 per page)
2. Secondary keywords (2-3 per page)
3. LSI/related terms to include naturally
4. Search intent (informational, commercial, transactional)
5. Content angle based on what's ranking

Output to `/spec/keyword-mapping.md`
```

**GATE 1.2**: Verify `/spec/keyword-mapping.md` exists with keywords for every planned page. If it does, update `/spec/build-state.md` and immediately proceed to Phase 1.5. If not, re-run the seo-research agent.

---

### Phase 1.5: Design Concepting (BEFORE CONTENT OR CODING)

**This phase creates a unique design direction for this specific site. No two builds should look the same.**

#### Step 1.5.1: Design Research
Spawn a `ui-expert` agent with:
```
You are creating a unique design concept for a website. Use the `/frontend-design:frontend-design` skill's Design Thinking framework.

INPUTS:
- Read /spec/brief.md for: business type, mood/tone, reference websites, brand colors, target audience
- Read /spec/content-requirements.md for: page types, content structure, competitor analysis

YOUR PROCESS:
1. UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT
   - What kind of business is this? What does their audience expect?
   - What mood/tone did the user request?
   - If reference websites were provided, analyze what makes them visually effective

2. COMMIT TO A BOLD AESTHETIC DIRECTION
   - Pick a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision
   - This is NOT "Premium Agency" or "Clean Editorial" — it's a bespoke direction for THIS business
   - What's the ONE THING someone will remember about this site?
   - Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work — the key is intentionality

3. MAKE SPECIFIC CHOICES (not generic ones)
   - Pick exact fonts (Google Fonts preferred for easy implementation)
   - Define exact hex values for the full palette
   - Choose specific layout patterns for each section type
   - Decide on a motion philosophy

ANTI-SLOP RULES (from /unslop-react-design):
- Do NOT default to: Inter, Roboto, Arial
- Do NOT default to: gradient blobs, frosted glass, radial glows
- Do NOT default to: centered hero with two buttons
- Do NOT default to: hero -> proof strip -> features -> pricing -> testimonials -> CTA
- Do NOT default to: 3-column equal card grids
- Do NOT default to: "Trusted by..." / "Get Started" / "Everything you need"
- If you catch yourself reaching for ANY common AI default, stop and make a genuinely different choice

OUTPUT: Create /spec/design-concept.md with this exact structure:

# Design Concept: [Business Name]

## Creative Direction
- **Tone:** [One clear sentence — not a generic label like "modern and clean"]
- **The Memorable Thing:** [What makes this site visually distinctive — be specific]
- **Differentiation:** [How this differs from competitor sites found in research]

## Typography
- **Display/Heading Font:** [Specific Google Font name] — [why this font suits the business]
- **Body Font:** [Specific Google Font name] — [why this pairing works]
- **Font Scale:** [Specific sizes — e.g., "H1: text-5xl md:text-7xl, H2: text-3xl md:text-4xl, Body: text-base md:text-lg"]
- **Special Treatment:** [Any distinctive typographic choices — large quotes, oversized numbers, etc.]

## Color Palette
- **Primary:** [#hex] — [what it conveys]
- **Secondary:** [#hex] — [usage]
- **Accent:** [#hex] — [used sparingly for CTAs and highlights]
- **Backgrounds:** [Not just "white" — specify section background variation: e.g., "#FAFAF8 main, #1a1a1a dark sections, #F0EDE8 warm sections"]
- **Text:** [#hex primary, #hex secondary/muted]

## Layout Patterns
For each section type, specify the EXACT layout approach:

### Hero
- **Layout:** [e.g., "Split screen — headline left (60%), atmospheric image right (40%)" or "Full-bleed image with overlay text bottom-left" — NOT "centered headline with two buttons"]
- **Content:** [What goes in the hero and what goes below the fold]

### Services/Features
- **Layout:** [e.g., "Asymmetric bento grid — 2 large cards top, 3 smaller below" or "Horizontal scroll cards" — NOT "3 equal columns"]
- **Card Style:** [If using cards — what makes them distinctive]

### Testimonials
- **Layout:** [e.g., "Large pull-quote with editorial typography" or "Stacked cards with photo + text side by side" — NOT "star rating + quote + avatar chip"]

### CTA Sections
- **Layout:** [e.g., "Dark section with large serif headline and single button" — NOT "Ready to get started?"]

### Footer
- **Layout:** [e.g., "Minimal single-line with links" or "Large 4-column with newsletter signup"]

## Motion & Animation
- **Philosophy:** [e.g., "Subtle and weighty — spring physics on interactions, gentle fade-ups on scroll" or "Bold and theatrical — staggered reveals, parallax depth"]
- **Page Load:** [What happens when the page first loads]
- **Scroll Behavior:** [How elements enter as user scrolls]
- **Hover States:** [How interactive elements respond]
- **Recommended taste-skill dials:** DESIGN_VARIANCE: [3-8], MOTION_INTENSITY: [3-7], VISUAL_DENSITY: [3-6]

## Component Style
- **Buttons:** [e.g., "Rounded pill with subtle shadow, no icon" or "Square with arrow trailing icon"]
- **Navigation:** [e.g., "Floating pill nav detached from top" or "Minimal left-aligned with hamburger on mobile"]
- **Cards:** [If used — specific border radius, shadow, padding, border treatment]
- **Icons:** [Style and source — e.g., "Phosphor Light, strokeWidth 1.5"]

## What NOT To Do (Site-Specific)
- [Patterns that would undermine this specific concept]
- [Common defaults for this business type to explicitly avoid]
- [At least 3 specific anti-patterns]
```

**GATE 1.5**: Verify `/spec/design-concept.md` exists and meets these criteria:
- Every section is filled in with SPECIFIC choices (no "TBD", no "standard", no "modern and clean")
- Font choices are NOT Inter, Roboto, or Arial
- Hero layout is NOT "centered headline with two buttons"
- At least 3 site-specific anti-patterns are listed
- The design concept reads as genuinely unique — not a template that could apply to any business

**If the design concept is too generic, re-spawn the ui-expert agent with stricter instructions. When it passes, update `/spec/build-state.md` and immediately proceed to Phase 2.**

---

### Phase 2: Content Writing & Image Generation (PARALLEL — BEFORE CODING)

**Do NOT proceed to coding until BOTH content and images are ready.**

Content writing and image generation run in parallel to save time. Images are generated from the brief and research output (not from content files, since content is being written simultaneously).

#### Track A: Content Writing

##### Step 2A.1: Write All Page Content
Spawn `copywriter` agent with:
```
Write content for all pages defined in the brief.

INPUTS:
- Read /spec/brief.md for business info, services, locations
- Read /spec/content-requirements.md for word count minimums
- Read /spec/keyword-mapping.md for SEO requirements

IMPORTANT: Use the `/unslop-writing` skill. Follow ALL its rules:
- Never use banned phrases ("In today's landscape", "Let's dive in", "Here's the thing", "At its core", etc.)
- Never use banned structural patterns (broad sweeping opener, "Final thoughts" section, rhetorical question transitions)
- Never use banned tonal patterns (breathless enthusiasm, false-authority voice, hedging every claim)
- Never use banned words (landscape, paradigm, leverage, robust, seamless, ecosystem, delve, navigate, unlock)
- Write like a specific human with a specific voice — not like a median of all writing on the internet

REQUIREMENTS:
- Each page MUST meet the minimum word count from content-requirements.md
- Include all required sections identified in research
- Naturally incorporate keywords from keyword-mapping.md
- Use the business's voice and USPs from the brief
- Write compelling CTAs
- Include local references for location pages

OUTPUT:
Create /spec/content/ folder with:
- homepage.md
- about.md
- contact.md
- services/[service-slug].md (one per service)
- locations/[location-slug].md (one per location)
- matrix/[location]-[service].md (ALL combinations - see Matrix Page Guide)

Each file should contain:
- Meta title
- Meta description
- H1
- Full page content with H2/H3 structure
- CTA text

MATRIX PAGE CONTENT (CRITICAL):
- Create content for ALL service × location combinations
- Each matrix page MUST have unique opening paragraph with local context
- At least 300 words per page must be unique to that specific combination
- Follow the Matrix Page Template Structure (see Matrix Page Guide below)
- Do NOT copy-paste between matrix pages - each must be genuinely unique
```

**GATE 2A (CONTENT QUALITY CHECK)**:
Verify ALL content files exist and meet requirements:

```
For each content file, check:
[ ] File exists in /spec/content/
[ ] Word count meets minimum from content-requirements.md
[ ] Contains meta title and description
[ ] Has clear H1, H2, H3 structure
[ ] Includes primary keyword naturally
[ ] Has compelling CTA
[ ] No placeholder text ("Lorem ipsum", "[INSERT]", "TODO")

MATRIX PAGE VERIFICATION (if applicable):
[ ] ALL service × location combinations have content files
[ ] Spot-check 3+ matrix pages for uniqueness
[ ] Opening paragraphs are DIFFERENT between matrix pages
[ ] Meta descriptions are UNIQUE per matrix page
[ ] Local context is genuine (not generic "We serve [location]")
```

**If ANY content file fails this check, re-spawn the copywriter agent to fix the failing content. Re-run this gate. Proceed only when all checks pass.**
**If matrix pages are duplicative or templated, this is a CRITICAL failure — re-spawn copywriter with specific instructions to make each page unique.**

#### Track B: Image Generation (runs in PARALLEL with Track A)

**Images are generated from the brief and research — NOT from content files (which are still being written).**

##### Step 2B.1: Plan Image Requirements
Review the brief and research output to identify required images:

```
Required images (minimum):
- Hero image for homepage
- Hero/header image for each service page
- Hero/header image for each location page (if distinct)
- About page team/business image
- Any images referenced in the brief
```

##### Step 2B.2: Generate Images
Spawn `art-director` agent with:
```
Generate images for the website based on the brief and research.

INPUTS:
- Read /spec/brief.md for business info, style direction, and brand
- Read /spec/content-requirements.md for page types and structure
- Note the design requirements (colors, style direction) from the brief

IMAGES TO GENERATE:
1. Homepage hero image
   - Should convey: [main business value proposition from brief]
   - Style: [from brief - modern/traditional/etc.]
   - Dimensions: 1920x1080 (will be cropped responsively)

2. Service page images (one per service)
   - Should represent the service being performed
   - Professional, trustworthy appearance
   - Dimensions: 1200x800

3. About page image
   - Should convey trust and professionalism
   - Could be: team at work, business premises, or professional portrait style
   - Dimensions: 1200x800

OUTPUT:
Save images to /public/images/ (or /src/assets/images/) with clear naming:
- hero-homepage.jpg
- hero-[service-slug].jpg
- hero-[location-slug].jpg (if needed)
- about-team.jpg

Create /spec/image-manifest.md listing all generated images with:
- Filename
- Purpose
- Dimensions
- Alt text recommendation
```

**GATE 2B**: Verify images exist and are appropriate:
```
For each required image:
[ ] File exists in /public/images/ or equivalent
[ ] Image is appropriate for a professional business site
[ ] Image matches the style direction from the brief
[ ] No AI artifacts that look unprofessional
[ ] /spec/image-manifest.md exists with alt text recommendations
```

**If images look unprofessional or have obvious AI artifacts, re-spawn the art-director agent to regenerate them. Re-check. Proceed when all images pass.**

#### GATE 2 (Combined): Both Tracks Must Pass
**Do NOT proceed to Phase 3 until BOTH GATE 2A and GATE 2B pass. When both pass, update `/spec/build-state.md` and immediately begin Phase 3.**

---

### Phase 3: Foundation
1. Spawn coder agent(s) for project setup, dependencies, base layout
   **IMPORTANT: Include in the coder prompt:**
   - "Read and follow `/spec/design-concept.md` for ALL design decisions — typography, colors, layout patterns, component styles, and motion approach"
   - "Use `/taste-skill` for technical guardrails (RSC safety, Tailwind version, performance). Use `/output-skill` for complete code. Use `/unslop-react-design` to avoid generic AI patterns"
   - "The design concept is your PRIMARY reference — follow its specific font, color, layout, and component choices exactly"
   - "Use the taste-skill dial values specified in design-concept.md"
   - "Follow ALL `/unslop-react-design` rules — no default SaaS stack layout, no gradient blobs, no frosted glass cards, no stock copy patterns, no Inter font, no 3-column pricing cards"
2. **GATE 3**: After coder completes:
   - Verify dev server is running
   - Navigate to localhost
   - Take screenshot
   - Check console for errors
   - If ANY issues: spawn coder agent to fix them, re-verify. When clean, update `/spec/build-state.md` and immediately proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 4: Core Pages (WITH REAL CONTENT)
1. Spawn coder agent(s) for homepage, main pages
2. **CRITICAL**: Coders MUST use content from `/spec/content/` - NO placeholder text
3. **CRITICAL**: Coders MUST follow Design Standards:
   - Hero: use the specific layout pattern from `/spec/design-concept.md`. Move remaining content below the fold.
   - Break all long-form content into scannable layouts (cards, grids, alternating sections)
   - Vary section backgrounds per the palette defined in design-concept.md
   - Read and follow `/spec/design-concept.md` for all design decisions. Use `/taste-skill` (technical guardrails), `/output-skill`, `/unslop-react-design`
   - Follow ALL `/unslop-react-design` bans — no stock layout patterns, no generic visual defaults, no cliche copy patterns
4. **GATE 4**: After coders complete:
   - Spawn quality-check agent
   - Quality check MUST screenshot at 375px, 768px, 1440px
   - Quality check MUST test homepage AND at least one inner page
   - **Quality check MUST verify real content is present (not Lorem ipsum)**
   - If quality check returns NOT READY or NEEDS WORK with Critical issues: spawn coder agent(s) to fix the issues, then re-run quality-check. When it passes, update `/spec/build-state.md` and immediately begin Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Additional Pages (Location/Service/Matrix) - WITH REAL CONTENT
1. Spawn coder agent(s) for remaining pages including ALL matrix combinations
2. **CRITICAL**: Coders MUST use content from `/spec/content/` for EVERY page
3. **CRITICAL**: Service and location pages must NOT be walls of text — use cards, grids, icons, alternating layouts
4. Coders MUST follow `/spec/design-concept.md` and use `/taste-skill` (technical guardrails), `/output-skill`, `/unslop-react-design`
5. **MATRIX PAGES**: Build ALL service × location combinations (see Matrix Page Guide below)
4. **GATE 5**: After coders complete:
   - Spawn quality-check agent
   - Quality check MUST test representative pages from EACH template type
   - **Quality check MUST verify word counts on rendered pages match spec**
   - **Quality check MUST flag any placeholder or thin content**
   - If quality check fails: spawn coder/copywriter agent(s) to fix the issues, then re-run quality-check. When it passes, update `/spec/build-state.md` and immediately begin Phase 6.

### Phase 6: Polish & Animations
1. Spawn coder agent(s) for animations, transitions, polish
   - Coders MUST follow the motion approach from `/spec/design-concept.md`, use `/taste-skill` for animation performance rules, and `/unslop-react-design` for anti-patterns
2. **GATE 6 (CRITICAL for animations)**:
   - Spawn quality-check agent
   - Quality check MUST take MULTIPLE screenshots:
     - Immediately on page load
     - After 2 seconds
     - After scrolling
     - After returning to top
   - If ANY screenshot shows invisible content: CRITICAL FAIL. Spawn coder agent to fix animation initial states (ensure content is visible without requiring scroll/interaction). Re-run the multi-screenshot check. When it passes, update `/spec/build-state.md` and immediately begin Phase 7.

### Phase 7: SEO Implementation & Final Touches
1. Spawn `seo-onpage` agent to implement:
   - Meta tags from `/spec/content/` files
   - Structured data (LocalBusiness, Service, etc.)
   - Sitemap generation
   - Internal linking optimization
2. **GATE 7**:
   - Verify all meta titles/descriptions are implemented (not defaults)
   - Quick visual check that nothing broke
   - When verified, update `/spec/build-state.md` and immediately begin Phase 8.

### Phase 8: Production Build Test
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Check for build errors
3. Run `npm run start` (production server)
4. **GATE 8**:
   - Take screenshots of PRODUCTION build
   - Compare to dev screenshots
   - If different: spawn coder agent to investigate and fix, re-build, re-check. When production matches dev, update `/spec/build-state.md` and immediately begin Phase 9.

## Matrix Page Guide (Service × Location Pages)

Matrix pages target "[Service] in [Location]" searches (e.g., "Boiler Repair in Greenhithe"). Build ALL combinations of services × locations.

### Calculating Matrix Pages

```
Total matrix pages = (number of services) × (number of locations)

Example:
- 5 services × 10 locations = 50 matrix pages
- 8 services × 15 locations = 120 matrix pages
```

### URL Structure

```
/[location]/[service]/
Examples:
- /greenhithe/boiler-repair/
- /dartford/gas-safety-certificates/
- /bexley/central-heating-installation/
```

### Content Uniqueness Rules (CRITICAL)

**The #1 failure mode for matrix pages is duplicate content.** Each page MUST be unique.

**What makes each matrix page unique:**

| Element | How to Make Unique |
|---------|-------------------|
| **H1** | Include BOTH location AND service: "Boiler Repair in Greenhithe" |
| **Opening paragraph** | Mention specific local context (landmarks, area characteristics) |
| **Service details** | Same service info is OK, but intro/outro must be location-specific |
| **Local proof points** | "We've completed X jobs in [location]" or local testimonials |
| **Travel/coverage info** | Specific to that location's geography |
| **CTA** | Location-specific: "Call for boiler repair in Greenhithe" |
| **Meta title** | "[Service] in [Location] | [Business Name]" |
| **Meta description** | Unique per page, mentioning both service and location |

**FORBIDDEN (will cause duplicate content penalties):**
- ❌ Same opening paragraph across all matrix pages
- ❌ Only changing the H1 and leaving body identical
- ❌ Generic "We serve [location]" with no real local content
- ❌ Identical meta descriptions with just location swapped
- ❌ Copy-pasting service description without local context

### Matrix Page Template Structure

```markdown
# [Service] in [Location]

## Opening (MUST be unique per page - 100+ words)
- Mention specific local context for [Location]
- Reference how the service relates to this area
- Include local landmarks, neighbourhoods, or characteristics

## Why Choose [Business] for [Service] in [Location] (150+ words)
- Local experience/jobs completed in area
- Response time to this specific location
- Knowledge of local property types/systems

## Our [Service] Process (can be shared across matrix pages)
- Step 1...
- Step 2...
- Step 3...

## [Service] for [Location] Properties (unique section - 150+ words)
- Property types common in this area
- Common issues in this location
- Local regulations or considerations

## Areas We Cover Near [Location] (unique)
- List nearby areas
- Internal links to adjacent location pages

## FAQs: [Service] in [Location] (2-3 unique FAQs)
- Location-specific questions
- Can share some service FAQs but include local ones

## Get [Service] in [Location] Today (CTA - unique)
- Location-specific call to action
- Phone number
- "Serving [Location] and surrounding areas"
```

### Minimum Word Counts for Matrix Pages

```
From content-requirements.md, but typically:
- Minimum: 800 words per matrix page
- Target: 1000-1200 words
- At least 300 words MUST be unique to that specific page
```

### Internal Linking for Matrix Pages

Each matrix page should link to:
- **Parent service page**: /services/[service]/
- **Parent location page**: /[location]/
- **Adjacent matrix pages**: Same service in nearby locations
- **Related services**: Other services in the same location

```
Example links on /greenhithe/boiler-repair/:
- "Learn more about our boiler repair services" → /services/boiler-repair/
- "See all services in Greenhithe" → /greenhithe/
- "Boiler repair in nearby Dartford" → /dartford/boiler-repair/
- "Need a gas safety certificate in Greenhithe?" → /greenhithe/gas-safety-certificates/
```

### Quality Check for Matrix Pages

When quality-checking matrix pages, verify:
```
[ ] ALL service × location combinations exist
[ ] Each page has unique H1 with service AND location
[ ] Opening paragraphs are NOT identical across pages
[ ] Meta descriptions are unique per page
[ ] Local content is genuinely local (not generic)
[ ] Internal links work to parent service/location pages
[ ] Word count meets minimum (check 3-5 random matrix pages)
[ ] No "thin content" warnings from SEO perspective
```

**If matrix pages look templated/identical, this is a CRITICAL failure. Fix before proceeding.**

### Phase 9: Final Quality Check
1. Spawn quality-check agent for comprehensive review
2. Quality check MUST:
   - Test ALL THREE viewports (375px, 768px, 1440px)
   - Test representative pages from every template
   - Check network tab for failed resources
   - Check console for errors
   - **CONTENT VERIFICATION**:
     - Verify NO placeholder text anywhere
     - Spot-check word counts on 2-3 pages against `/spec/content-requirements.md`
     - Verify meta titles/descriptions are unique per page (not defaults)
   - Run the "Three Questions" test:
     - Does this look like £10k+ agency work?
     - Would a business owner be proud?
     - Does this compete with the best in the industry?
3. **ONLY output `<promise>BUILD COMPLETE</promise>` if quality check returns "READY TO SHIP"**
   - If quality check returns NOT READY: spawn agents to fix issues, re-run quality check. Repeat until READY TO SHIP or 3 attempts exhausted (then document blockers).

#### Web Design Quality Gate (Premium-Feel Halo Check)

Zero auto-fail items from `~/.Codex/knowledgebase/website-design/checklist.md`. The quality-check agent's auto-fail criteria now cover: 50ms halo, opacity hierarchy, star of show, no felt hover states. Verify on homepage + one inner page at all three viewports:

- **50ms blink test** — within half a second of load, hero communicates what the business does and why it matters [KB: checklist.md → Hero/50ms].
- **Opacity hierarchy present** — body copy uses 100/87/60 tiers, not all 100% [KB: checklist.md → Typography/Opacity].
- **Star of the show** — one element on the landing page anchors the eye long enough to convert attention [KB: checklist.md → Star].
- **Felt hover states** — interactive elements respond with motion/shadow/colour shift, not just cursor change [KB: checklist.md → Hover].
- **Three-level type scale** — anchor headline dramatically larger than supporting copy [KB: checklist.md → Typography].
- **No generic AI patterns** — no gradient blobs, frosted glass, default Inter, stock "Trusted by" rows [KB: applying-to-skills.md].

## Code Review Placement

Code reviews happen WITHIN phases, but they are NOT the quality gate:

```
Coder completes → Code Review → Fix issues → THEN → Quality Check (visual)
```

Code review = reading code for bugs, security, best practices
Quality check = LOOKING at the site in a browser

**Both are required. Code review alone is NOT sufficient for UI work.**

## Quality Check Agent Instructions

When spawning a quality-check agent, remind it:

```
You are checking if this site is ready to ship.

REMEMBER:
- Default to FAIL, not pass
- You're a harsh client who paid £10k
- List EVERY issue, not just a few
- Compare to professional sites (Apple, Stripe, Linear)
- If ANY doubt, verdict is NOT READY

CONTENT VERIFICATION (MANDATORY):
- Read /spec/content-requirements.md to know minimum word counts
- Check AT LEAST 3 pages for actual word count vs. required
- Flag ANY placeholder text (Lorem ipsum, TODO, [INSERT], etc.)
- Verify meta titles are unique and descriptive (not "Page Title | Site Name" defaults)
- Check that content mentions the business name and is locally relevant
- Verify H1s exist and are unique per page

CONTENT FAILURES = AUTOMATIC NOT READY:
- Placeholder text anywhere = NOT READY
- Word count below spec = NOT READY
- Duplicate content across pages = NOT READY
- Generic content without local relevance = NOT READY

DESIGN VERIFICATION (MANDATORY):
- Hero section: Is it concise (headline + subheadline + CTA) or a wall of text? Wall of text = CRITICAL FAIL
- Typography: Is there clear visual hierarchy? (H1 dramatically larger than body, H2 distinct from H3)
- Layout variety: Does the page alternate between different section layouts, or is it the same pattern repeated?
- Spacing: Is there generous whitespace between sections, or does everything feel cramped?
- Visual rhythm: Do section backgrounds vary (alternating light/dark/tinted), or is every section identical?
- Content presentation: Are services/features shown as cards/grids, or as plain text paragraphs?
- Compare to Stripe.com or Linear.app — does the typography, spacing, and layout feel similarly intentional?

DESIGN FAILURES = AUTOMATIC NOT READY:
- Hero section with 3+ sentences of body text = NOT READY
- No visible typography hierarchy (headings barely distinguishable from body) = NOT READY
- Same section layout repeated 4+ times on one page = NOT READY
- All sections have identical white backgrounds with no variation = NOT READY
- Services/features presented as plain paragraph text (no cards, grids, or icons) = NOT READY

DESIGN CONCEPT ADHERENCE CHECK (MANDATORY):
- Read /spec/design-concept.md before starting the quality check
- Does the hero use the specific layout pattern defined in design-concept.md? If not = NOT READY
- Are the fonts from design-concept.md actually implemented? (Check rendered fonts, not just CSS) If not = NOT READY
- Does the color palette match design-concept.md? If not = NOT READY
- Do section layouts follow the patterns specified in design-concept.md? If not = NOT READY
- Does the site deliver on "The Memorable Thing" from the design concept? If not = NOT READY
- Could you swap the logo and this would look like any other business website? = NOT READY

ANTI-SLOP DESIGN CHECK (from /unslop-react-design):
- Does the layout follow the generic SaaS stack (hero -> proof strip -> features -> pricing -> testimonials -> CTA)? = NOT READY
- Are there radial glows, blurred orbs, or gradient haze behind the hero? = NOT READY
- Are there frosted glass cards or translucent panels as default polish? = NOT READY
- Is the heading font Inter, Roboto, or Arial without explicit brief justification? = NOT READY
- Are there stock copy patterns: "Trusted by...", "Built for...", "Everything you need", "Ready to...?", "Get Started"? = NOT READY
- Are testimonials shown as 5-star + quote + avatar chip default pattern? = NOT READY
- Does it look like every other AI-generated website? = NOT READY

ANTI-SLOP CONTENT CHECK (from /unslop-writing):
- Does content start with "In today's [adjective] landscape/world"? = NOT READY
- Does content use "Let's dive in", "Here's the thing", "At its core", "At the end of the day"? = NOT READY
- Does content use "seamless", "robust", "leverage", "ecosystem", "holistic", "delve"? = NOT READY
- Does content end with "Final thoughts" or "Key takeaways"? = NOT READY
- Does content use breathless enthusiasm ("fascinating", "game-changing", "transformative")? = NOT READY
- Does content feel like generic AI writing rather than a specific human voice? = NOT READY

The Three Questions:
1. Does this look like £10k+ agency work? [YES/NO]
2. Would a business owner be proud? [YES/NO]
3. Does this compete with the best? [YES/NO]

If ANY answer is NO, verdict is NOT READY or NEEDS WORK.
```

## Red Flags That Require Immediate Quality Check

If a coder mentions ANY of these, spawn quality-check immediately:
- "animation" / "opacity" / "transition" / "fadeIn"
- "should work" (without verification)
- Any console error, even "minor"
- "done" without mentioning screenshots
- Coder creates hero with more than 2 sentences of body text
- All sections on a page use the same background color
- Services listed as paragraphs instead of cards/grid
- Coder uses Inter font, gradient blobs, frosted glass cards, or "Trusted by" copy (unslop violations)
- Layout follows generic hero -> proof strip -> features -> pricing -> testimonials -> CTA stack
- CTA text is "Get Started", "Book a Demo", or "Start Free Trial" (stock copy from unslop-react-design)
- Coder ignores /spec/design-concept.md and uses different fonts, colors, or layouts than specified
- Site looks interchangeable with any other business site (fails the "swap the logo" test)

---

## Content Red Flags (STOP and FIX immediately)

If you see ANY of these, STOP the build and fix content first:
- "Lorem ipsum" or placeholder text anywhere
- "TODO", "FIXME", "[INSERT]", "[PLACEHOLDER]" in content
- Coder saying "I'll add content later"
- Pages with less than 300 words (unless specifically designed as minimal)
- Service/location pages with less than 800 words (check against spec)
- Repeated content across multiple pages (duplicate content)
- Generic content that doesn't mention the business name or location
- Meta descriptions that are defaults or identical across pages
- Missing H1 or multiple H1s on a page
- Content that doesn't match the keyword mapping

**Content shortcuts are NOT acceptable. Fix them before proceeding.**

---

## Completion Criteria

**You may ONLY output `<promise>BUILD COMPLETE</promise>` when:**
1. `/spec/brief.md` was either provided by user or generated from Phase 0 interview
2. Phase 1 research completed (content-requirements.md + keyword-mapping.md)
3. Phase 2 content + images completed in parallel (all content files + image manifest)
4. All coding phases completed (Phases 3-8)
5. All quality gates passed
6. Final quality-check returned "READY TO SHIP"
7. Production build works
8. All three viewports tested
9. No Critical issues remain
10. **Content requirements met:**
    - `/spec/content-requirements.md` exists with word count specs
    - `/spec/keyword-mapping.md` exists with keywords per page
    - All content files exist in `/spec/content/`
    - No placeholder text on any page
    - Word counts verified against spec
11. **Image requirements met:**
    - `/spec/image-manifest.md` exists listing all images
    - Hero images exist for homepage and key pages
    - Images are professional quality (no obvious AI artifacts)
    - Alt text defined for all images

**If any gate fails, fix issues autonomously by spawning the appropriate agents, re-run the gate, and continue. Do not ask the user for help unless stuck after 3 attempts on the same gate.**

---

## Anti-Sycophancy Reminder

The quality-check agent may try to be "helpful" by approving mediocre work.

If a quality check comes back positive but you have doubts:
1. Ask for a more critical re-evaluation
2. Request specific comparison to professional sites
3. Ask "Would a client paying £10k be satisfied?"

**Do not trust rubber-stamp approvals. Challenge them if needed.**
