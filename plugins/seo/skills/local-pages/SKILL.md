## Workflow

### Phase 1: Research (Perplexity)

Before writing any content, use `mcp__perplexity__perplexity_ask` to gather subject matter expertise.

**Note:** Use `perplexity_ask` (sonar-pro) for cost efficiency. Only use `perplexity_research` (sonar-deep-research) when explicitly requested for complex topics requiring extensive citations.

**Research Prompt Template:**

```
Research the following for a local business website:

Topic: [SERVICE/BUSINESS TYPE]
Location: [LOCATION if applicable]
Target audience: Homeowners/businesses looking for [SERVICE]

Provide:
1. Common problems/pain points customers face with [SERVICE]
2. Key questions customers ask when hiring a [BUSINESS TYPE]
3. Important certifications, qualifications, or accreditations in this field (UK-specific)
4. Common misconceptions about [SERVICE]
5. Typical price ranges or pricing factors (UK market)
6. Seasonal considerations or timing factors
7. Red flags customers should watch for when choosing a provider
8. What differentiates quality providers from poor ones

Focus on factual, specific information that demonstrates expertise.
```

### Phase 2: Keyword Integration Plan

Before writing, plan keyword placement:

**Primary Keyword Must Appear In:**
- Title tag (front-loaded)
- H1 heading
- First 100 words of body copy
- At least one H2 heading
- Meta description
- URL slug

**Secondary Keywords/Variations:**
- Distribute naturally across H2/H3 headings
- Use in body copy where relevant
- Include in image alt text

### Phase 2.5: Content Differentiation Planning

Before writing, ensure each page will be genuinely unique. See `../copywriting/references/seo-indexing-guidelines.md` for full indexing principles.

**For Location Pages:**
- Identify 3+ locally-specific details (landmarks, neighbourhoods, local issues)
- Find location-specific customer pain points
- Include area-specific proof (local testimonials, jobs completed in area)
- Avoid: identical structures with just town names swapped

**For Service Pages:**
- Identify unique angle vs competitors (specialisation, approach, experience)
- Include specific examples, case studies, or scenarios
- Add genuine expertise competitors haven't covered

**Differentiation Test:** Could a competitor copy this content by just changing the business name? If yes, it needs more specificity.

### Phase 3: Content Structure

See `references/page-structures.md` for detailed templates.

**Service Page Structure (1000+ words):**
```
[Title Tag: Primary Keyword + Benefit + Location | Business Name]
[Meta Description: 150-155 chars with keyword + benefit + CTA]

H1: [Primary Keyword] + [Benefit/Differentiator]
    Lead paragraph (100-150 words): Address reader's situation, core promise

H2: [Keyword variation] - What We Do / How It Works
    (200-300 words): Clear explanation of service

H2: [Keyword variation] - Why Choose [Business Name]
    (200-300 words): Differentiators with proof, credentials, guarantees

H2: [Related keyword] - Common [Service] Problems We Fix
    (200-300 words): Demonstrate expertise, address specific situations

H2: Frequently Asked Questions About [Primary Keyword]
    (150-250 words): FAQ schema opportunity, address objections

H2: [Location] Areas We Cover
    (50-100 words): Local signals, nearby areas

H2: Get Your [Service] Sorted Today
    (50-100 words): Clear CTA with contact details
```

**Location Page Structure (1000-1500 words):**
```
[Title Tag: Primary Service + Location | Business Name]
[Meta Description: 150-155 chars with location + service + CTA]

H1: [Primary Service] in [Location]
    Lead paragraph (100-150 words): Location-specific opening, local credibility

H2: [Service 1] in [Location]
    (250-350 words): Full service description for this location

H2: [Service 2] in [Location]
    (250-350 words): Full service description

H2: [Service 3] in [Location]
    (250-350 words): Full service description

H2: Why [Location] Residents Choose [Business Name]
    (150-200 words): Local proof, testimonials, differentiators

H2: Areas We Cover Near [Location]
    (50-100 words): Nearby towns, postcodes

CTA section with contact details
```

### Phase 4: Writing

Apply copywriting principles from `references/copywriting-rules.md`:

1. **Reason-Why Framework** — Every claim must have proof
2. **Rule of One** — One dominant message per section
3. **Customer Awareness** — Match approach to reader awareness level
4. **Specificity** — Numbers, credentials, named testimonials over vague claims

Apply SEO integration from `references/seo-rules.md`:

1. **Natural keyword usage** — Never stuff, always readable
2. **Keyword-rich headings** — Include variations in H2/H3s
3. **Local signals** — Geographic terms, local proof, contact info
4. **Schema markup** — Recommend LocalBusiness, FAQ, Review schemas
